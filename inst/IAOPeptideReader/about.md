# Welcome to IAOPeptideReader!

## About

IAOPeptideReader is a tool that helps to decide between different methods of protein digestion. It compares IAO (Ion Accounting Output) peptide files from ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) and provides a score for each of them. Based on the result, the experimenter can make an explainable choice between datasets based on their aim of the experiment. 

For more information on how IAOPeptideReader works, explore the tools and check additional information in the helpers of the elements - marked as a circle with a question mark.

## HaDeXversum

IAOPeptideReader is a part of a tool family called HaDeXversum, focused on analysing the data from the HDX experiments.
Other parts of the HaDeXversum are:

### Resources

For more information of the HDX-MS field and recent development of dedicated tools, we created a [HDX-MS resources list](https://github.com/hadexversum/HDX-MS-resources). It is manually curated and frequently updated.
### HaDeX

A [web server](https://hadex.mslab-ibb.pl/) and [R package](https://github.com/hadexversum/HaDeX) for processing the experimental data files from DynamX. HaDeX provides a vast range of information - coverage plot, peptide kinetic plot, comparison plot and differential plot (using different methods of calculation). All of the plots are customizable and publication ready. There is also a recommended summary of the experiment. All of the results can be exported in a form of a report. 

HaDeX is actively developed.
